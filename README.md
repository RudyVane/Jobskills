The apps uses chatGPT to get the skills from the job offer and the user's skillmatrix, to compare them and make a list of matching skills and missing skills and calculates a matching percentage.
The created API will be deployed on Discord.

The first version will be a MVP, which can be expanded with more features.

The API is ment to be used by people who do or did the codeGorilla Java bootcamp or other courses at codeGorilla/Alyx
